Deep Learning using TensorFlow and Keras\n

Convolutional Deep Neural Network that uses the data supplied here: https://www.kaggle.com/biancaferreira/african-wildlife/data
to predict one of four animals given a picture of that animal. Further optimization can be done by altering parameters and using TensorBoard to visualize the effect that altering these parameters have on the model.
