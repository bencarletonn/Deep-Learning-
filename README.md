# Deep-Learning-
Deep Learning with:
- TensorFlow and Keras
- PyTorch (GUI using Kivy) 

tf-processingData.py and tf-model.py:

Convolutional Neural Network that uses the data supplied here: https://www.kaggle.com/biancaferreira/african-wildlife/data
to predict one of four animals given a picture of that animal. Further optimization can be done by altering parameters and using TensorBoard to visualize the effect that altering these parameters have on the model. 


pytorchMNISTmodel.py and pytorchMNISTgui.py 

Convolutional Neural Network that uses the data supplied in the MNIST digit dataset to predict an integer from 0-9. I have also made a simple GUI using the kivy module to allow users to draw a digit to pass into the CNN.
